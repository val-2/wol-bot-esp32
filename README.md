## üìÑ Description
This is a sketch for the ESP32 board. A telegram bot is hosted on the board and listens for messages, when the `/wol` command is received a Wake-on-Lan magic packet is broadcasted on the local network in order to turn on a target device.

ü™ô You can keep it running for about **1$** in electricity per year, the power consumption is less than half a watt.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

- Install the following libraries from the Library Manager of the Arduino IDE:
  - [WakeOnLan](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/wakeonlan/): for sending the magic packet
  - [UniversalTelegramBot](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/universaltelegrambot/): for using the Telegram API
- Create a new Telegram bot and configure your `BOT_TOKEN` and `ALLOWED_ID`  
  _You can use [@Botfather](https://t.me/botfather) to create a new bot and [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) to get your ID_
- Fill your _WiFi configuration_ and the _MAC address_ of the PC you want to power on
- Compile and flash

## üîé Usage

- Use `/start` to get a list of the available commands
- Use the `/wol` command or press the physical button to turn on your PC
- Use the `/ping` command to check if the bot is online

## ‚úÖ TODO List

- [ ] Refactor code
- [ ] Store network configuration in EEPROM
- [ ] Add configuration commands to Telegram bot
